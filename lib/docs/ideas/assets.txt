Search for assets licensed under Creative Commons. Websites like Freesound.org (for audio) and Pixabay (for images) have assets you can use, just be sure to check the license requirements.

3. Game Development Communities
Join communities on platforms like Reddit (e.g., r/gamedev, r/IndieDev) or Discord servers focused on game development. Many developers share free resources or are willing to collaborate.
